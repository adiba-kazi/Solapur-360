        <h2>Collectorate - District Administrative Setup</h2>

        <p>The Solapur district comprises 6 Revenue Sub-Divisions, 11 Revenue Tehsils, 91 Revenue Circles, and 1144 Revenue Villages.</p>

        <p>The administration of the Taluka is run by the Tahsildar. They report to their respective Sub Divisional Officers and the District Collector. The overall administration of a Sub-Division is taken care of by a Sub-Divisional Officer who, in turn, reports to the District Collector.</p>

        <p>District Collector / District Magistrate is mainly responsible for the District Administration. The District Collector is assisted by Resident Deputy Collector and the Sub-Divisional Officers to maintain law and order in the district. The Tahsildar of the Taluka is responsible for the law and order situation in their respective Talukas. The flow of instructions/orders is mainly from the Collector to S.D.O.â€™s and then to Tahsildars.</p>
