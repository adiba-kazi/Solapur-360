    <h2>About District</h2>
    <p>The Solapur District was ruled by various dynesties such as Andhrabhratyas, Chalukyas, Rashtrkutas, 
        Yadavas and Bahamanis. ‘SOLAPUR’ is believed to be derived from two words ‘SOLA’ meaning sixteen and 
        ‘PUR’ meaning village. The present city of Solapur was considered tp be spread over sixteen villages 
        viz. Aadilpur, Ahmedpur, Chapaldev, Fatehpur, Jamdarwadi, Kalajapur, Khadarpur, Khandervkiwadi, 
        Muhammadpur, Ranapur, Sandalpur, Shaikpur, Solapur, Sonalagi, Sonapur and Vaidakwadi.</p>
    <p>Recent research work however shows that the name SOLAPUR is derived not from the congregation of sixteen
         villages. It is evident from the inscriptions of Shivayogi Shri.Siddheshwar of the time of the Kalachuristis 
         of Kalyani, that the town was called ‘Sonnalage’ which came to be pronounced as ‘Sonnalagi’. The town was 
         known as Sonnalagi even upto the times of Yadavas. A sanskrit inscription dated Shake 1238, after the downfall
        of the Yadavas found at Kamati in Mohol shows that the town was known as Sonalipur.  One of the inscriptions 
        found in Solapur fort shows that the town was called Sonalpur while another inscription on the well in the 
        fort shows that it was known as Sandalpur.</p>
    <p>During the Muslim period, the town was known as Sandalpur. It is therefore most probably that that during 
        the course of time the name Solapur was evolved by dropping ‘na’ from the name Sonalpur. Subsequently the 
        British rulers pronounced Solapur as Sholapur and hence the name of the district.</p>
    <p>The importance of Solapur is unique in the history of India in the sense that this district enjoyed the 
        freedom even before independence. The citizens of Solapur enjoyed the Independence for three days from 9th
         to 11th May 1930. The brief history runs like this. After the arrest of Mahatma Gandhi in May 1930, protests 
         and demonstrations against the British Rule were held throughout the India. Large scale rallies and protests 
         were done at Solapur also. Many citizens lost their lives in the Police firings. Due to this the irate mob attacked
        the Police Stations. Out of fear the Police and other officers ran out of Solapur. During this period the 
        responsibility of law, order and security of citizens was on the shoulders of congress party leaders.</p>
    <p>Then city congress President Shri.Ramkrishna Jaju, with his other congressmen maintained the law and order 
        for a period of three days from 9th to 11th May 1930. Secondly, the Solapur Municipal Council was the first
        Municipal Council of India to host the National Flag on the Municipal Council building (Now Municipal Corporation)
        Solapur in 1930. The brief history runs like this. Taking the spirit of Dandi March from Mahatma Gandhi, 
        the freedom fighters of Solapur decided to host the National Flag on the Solapur Municipal Council. 
        Accordingly, senior freedom fighter from Pune Shri.Annasaheb Bhopatkar hosted the National Flag on 6th April 1930 on Municipal Council. This was the first and the unique incidence of such kind throughout the country. The British rulers, due to irritation declared the Marshall Law at Solapur and arrested many leaders and innocent citizens on false charges. The freedom fighters Shri.Mallappa Dhanshetti, Shri.Kurban Hussain, Shri.Jagnnath Shinde and Shri.Kisan Sarda were arrested on charges of killing two Policemen of Mangalwar Police Station. The lower court sentenced the punishment of hanging till death for these freedom fighters. The High Court also confirmed the same decision and these four freedom fighters were hanged till death on 12th January 1931. As a mark of respect to these freedom fighters, the Statues of these freedom fighters have been installed in the heart of the City and the location has been named as Hutatma Chowk.</p>
